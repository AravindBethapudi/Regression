**House Price Prediction using Machine Learning**
Built a regression model to predict house prices based on multiple features such as crime rate, room numbers, and distance from employment hubs. Tested models including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. The best performance was achieved using Gaussian Process Regressor, with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 14.23. Employed Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn for data preprocessing and visualization, and used Matplotlib to present results.
